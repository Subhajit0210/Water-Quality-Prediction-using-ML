## Introduction

Ensuring water quality is critical for public health and safety. This project aims to classify water samples as potable or non-potable using a dataset comprising various indicators of water quality. By applying multiple machine learning algorithms, this project seeks to accurately predict water potability and understand the factors that most significantly affect water quality.

## Dataset

The dataset utilized in this project is `water_potability.csv`, which includes the following features:

- **pH**: A measure of how acidic/basic water is.
- **Hardness**: The amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water.
- **Solids**: The total dissolved solids in ppm (parts per million).
- **Chloramines**: The concentration of chloramines in ppm.
- **Sulfate**: The amount of sulfate in ppm.
- **Conductivity**: Electrical conductivity of the water in μS/cm.
- **Organic Carbon**: The total organic carbon content in ppm.
- **Trihalomethanes**: Concentration of trihalomethanes in μg/L.
- **Turbidity**: The cloudiness or haziness of the water.
- **Potability**: A binary variable indicating whether the water is safe to drink (1) or not (0).

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset file `water_potability.csv`.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **models/**: Serialized model files for reuse.
- **results/**: Evaluation results and metrics.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## Installation

To replicate the analysis and modeling environment, you need Python 3.x and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn jupyter joblib
